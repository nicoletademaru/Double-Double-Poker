# Double-Double-Bonus-Poker

## Background 

Double Double Bonus Poker was my grandparents favorite machine to play in Vegas, and Vagas was their favorite place to visit. Whenever our family would go to Vegas. my granparents would sit everyone down and put $100 in every machine. As a tribute to them, and the fond memories of gambling with them, this game is a recreation of the Double Double Bonus Poker machines in Vegas and each game will start with 100 credits. 

## Game Play

This game is a variation of the classic Poker game we all know and love. Rather than playing against others, Double Double Bonus Poker is a single player game where you are dealt 5 cards and have 1 turn to switch any cards in your hands with the deck. 

## Fucntionality and MVPs

While playing this game the user will be able to:
 - Increase and decrease their bet between 1 - 5 credits every deal
 - Select a mex bet option that will automatically set the bet to 5 and deal a new hand
 - Hold cards 
 - Deal a new hand after every game to continue playing
 - Restart the game to the default 100 starting credits
